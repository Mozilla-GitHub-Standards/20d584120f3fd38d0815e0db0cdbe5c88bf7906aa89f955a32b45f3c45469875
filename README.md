shavar-list-exceptions
======================
This is the list of domains that we omit from Disconnect's upstream blocklist when generating `mozpub-track-digest256`. Lines starting with # are ignored.

Commits to this repo trigger rebuild and repush of shavar-list-creation, resulting in a new blocklist in s3.
